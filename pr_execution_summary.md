## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Steps:
1. **GitHub CLI Installed**: Successfully installed GitHub CLI v2.74.2
2. **Branch Analysis**: Found and verified both required branches
   - `main` branch âœ…
   - `new-branch` branch âœ… (matches requested "new_branch")
3. **Branch Checkout**: Successfully checked out `new-branch`
4. **Changes Identified**: Found 1 commit difference between branches
   - Commit: `c8b74f5 Update .gitkeep`

### ðŸ“‹ Branch Comparison:
```
new-branch: c8b74f5 (HEAD -> new-branch, origin/new-branch) Update .gitkeep
main:       1131267 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Add backend folder
```

## Final Step Required

To complete the PR creation, you need to authenticate GitHub CLI:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Authenticate first
gh auth login

# Then create the PR
gh pr create \
  --title "Pull Request: new-branch to main" \
  --body "Merging changes from new-branch into main branch as requested" \
  --base main \
  --head new-branch
```

### Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/Voltus-wave/PWC
2. Click "Compare & pull request" 
3. Ensure:
   - Base: `main`
   - Compare: `new-branch`
4. Add title: "Pull Request: new-branch to main"
5. Add description: "Merging changes from new-branch into main branch as requested"
6. Click "Create pull request"

### Option 3: Using GitHub API with Token
```bash
# Set your GitHub token
export GH_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"

# Create PR using CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "Pull Request: new-branch to main" \
  --body "Merging changes from new-branch into main branch as requested" \
  --base main \
  --head new-branch
```

## Repository Details
- **Repository**: `github.com/Voltus-wave/PWC`
- **Current Branch**: `new-branch` âœ…
- **Target Repository**: PWC (assuming this is the Qmentis repository referenced)
- **Changes**: 1 commit updating .gitkeep file

## Ready for PR Creation! ðŸš€

All prerequisites are met. The repository is set up correctly with:
- âœ… Source branch (`new-branch`) checked out
- âœ… Target branch (`main`) available
